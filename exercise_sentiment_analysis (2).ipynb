        "### **Exercise: Sentiment Analysis and Key Insights Extraction from Ford Car Reviews**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Problem Statement:**\n",
        "You have been provided with a dataset containing Ford car reviews. Your task is to use LangChain and the concepts you’ve learned to perform the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of each review, categorize it as positive, neutral, or negative, and store the result.\n",
        "2. **Key Insights Extraction**: Extract key pieces of information from each review, such as the pros and cons mentioned, and the specific features the reviewer liked or disliked (e.g., vehicle performance, comfort, price).\n",
        "\n",
        "You will build a LangChain-based solution that leverages language models to automatically extract this information and provide a structured summary of the reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### **Steps to Solve:**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 1: Load the Dataset**\n",
        "- The dataset file is named `ford_car_reviews.csv` and is sourced from Kaggle: [Edmunds Consumer Car Ratings and Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankkur13/edmundsconsumer-car-ratings-and-reviews).\n",
        "- For this exercise, **limit the data to the first 25 records**. This can be achieved by using `df.head(25)` or `df.iloc[:25]` when loading the data into a DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 2: Define the Sentiment Analysis Task**\n",
        "- Use LangChain to create a pipeline to classify the sentiment of each review.\n",
        "- Define prompts that can guide the model to evaluate the sentiment. For example:\n",
        "  - \"Given the following car review, classify the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 3: Key Insights Extraction**\n",
        "- Use LangChain to create a pipeline to extract pros, cons, and notable features from each review. Define prompts such as:\n",
        "  - \"What are the pros and cons of the vehicle described in the following review?\"\n",
        "  - \"What specific features of the vehicle does the reviewer like or dislike?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 4: Update the DataFrame with New Information**\n",
        "- Run the pipeline for each review and collect the sentiment and insights.\n",
        "- Once the analysis and extraction are complete, update the original DataFrame with additional columns to include:\n",
        "  - Sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)\n",
        "  - Pros\n",
        "  - Cons\n",
        "  - Liked_Features\n",
        "  - Disliked_Features\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example Output:**\n",

After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver.

Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver.

            "Review:  I bought mine 4/17 with 98K. Have been wanting a V6 5-sp, '05-'09 vintage for years. The engine is fine. Sounds good. Great mileage. Good power. I pride myself on smooth take-off and gear changes, but this is the orneriest transmission I've ever used! The difference between idle and 4000 rpm is about 1/8\" on the gas pedal, so starting-out without either stalling or way over-revving takes a LOT of finesse. Gear changes are very difficult to master smoothly without lurching. The ride is very harsh with a lot of road noise, which I suppose goes with a quasi high-performance car. My '01 S-10 is quieter and smoother. All that said, it's a smokin' hot looking car, and still fun to drive. This was the first-off of the modern 'Stangs. Hopefully these problems have been ironed-out since.\n",

Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver.

I've had the car for 2 years and have about 52,000 miles on her with zero problems.  For the price, you really can't beat it either (16300 in 2009 with 33k miles). Its faster, better looking, and really just more of a car than any used BMW/mercedes within its pricing segment.  The only comparable competitor in the used car market this years Mustang has is in the 350z, which handles better but lacks in practicality.  And on top of that, the Z doesn't sound as good as the 8 and after test driving could be a nightmare as a daily driver\n",

Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford\",\n          \" This was my first new car purchase and I really liked it at first....Untill everyone in Oklahoma city bought one. Atleast there will be pleanty around to pull parts of in the salvage yard. Guys and gals, this car is what it is plus a tiny, tiny bit more..... It's a (new) $20,000 sports car. I do actually love mine and it runs great but I can see it going to pieces not too far down the road. It's starting to rattle a little much and the two \\\"subs\\\" in the door aren't subs....

Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford\",\n          \" This was my first new car purchase and I really liked it at first....Untill everyone in Oklahoma city bought one. Atleast there will be pleanty around to pull parts of in the salvage yard. Guys and gals, this car is what it is plus a tiny, tiny bit more..... It's a (new) $20,000 sports car. I do actually love mine and it runs great but I can see it going to pieces not too far down the road. It's starting to rattle a little much and the two \\\"subs\\\" in the door aren't subs....

Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford\",\n          \" This was my first new car purchase and I really liked it at first....Untill everyone in Oklahoma city bought one. Atleast there will be pleanty around to pull parts of in the salvage yard. Guys and gals, this car is what it is plus a tiny, tiny bit more..... It's a (new) $20,000 sports car. I do actually love mine and it runs great but I can see it going to pieces not too far down the road. It's starting to rattle a little much and the two \\\"subs\\\" in the door aren't subs.... Subs are made to play mounted in a box, not mounted in a door but hats off to ford for at least trying to be hip. \",\n          \" Doesn\\u2019t disappoint\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.6090891423538375,\n        \"min\": 3.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.5,\n          5.0,\n          4.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Pros\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Good fuel economy, spacious interior\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cons\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Harsh ride, noisy engine\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Liked_Features\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Disliked_Features\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
